# Development Environment Setup â€“ Phase 3: Hot Reload & Optimization

## Overview
Optimize the development experience with advanced hot reload features, performance optimizations, and comprehensive development documentation. This phase ensures the fastest possible development workflow.

## Objectives
- [ ] Configure Vite HMR (Hot Module Replacement)
- [ ] Set up CSS hot reload
- [ ] Configure asset hot reload
- [ ] Set up development proxy for API calls
- [ ] Optimize development build performance
- [ ] Create development documentation

## Deliverables
- File: `vite.config.js` - Final optimized Vite configuration
- File: `src/utils/hmr-handler.js` - Custom HMR handlers for game state
- File: `src/utils/dev-proxy.js` - Development proxy configuration
- File: `docs/development-setup.md` - Development setup guide
- File: `docs/hot-reload-guide.md` - Hot reload usage guide
- File: `docs/debugging-guide.md` - Debugging and development tools guide
- File: `src/utils/performance-monitor.js` - Development performance monitoring
- File: `src/utils/state-preservation.js` - Game state preservation during reload
- File: `tests/unit/dev-tools.test.js` - Development tools unit tests
- File: `tests/integration/hot-reload.test.js` - Hot reload integration tests

## Dependencies
