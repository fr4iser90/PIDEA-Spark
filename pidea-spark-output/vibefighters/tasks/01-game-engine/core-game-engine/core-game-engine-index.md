# Task 1: Core Game Engine Foundation

## 📋 **Task Overview**

**Task:** Core Game Engine Foundation  
**Category:** Game Engine  
**Estimated Time:** 10 hours  
**Status:** Planning  
**Dependencies:** None  

## 🎯 **Goal**

Development of the **Core Game Engine Foundation** for a **stage-based 2D action-fighting game** in the style of Little Fighter 2. The system supports **multi-character navigation** through stages, **team-based gameplay** and **stage-based combat** instead of arena duels.

## 🎮 **Gameplay Concept**

### **Little Fighter 2 Style:**
- 🏃 **Stage Navigation** - Characters move through levels
- 👥 **Team Formation** - 1-4 characters per team
- ⚔️ **Multi-Enemy Combat** - Fighting multiple NPCs simultaneously
- 🗺️ **Level Progression** - Running through various stages
- 🎯 **Boss Encounters** - Special enemies at the end of stages

### **NOT Street Fighter Style:**
- ❌ No 1v1 arena combat
- ❌ No direct duels
- ❌ No round-based system

## 📊 **Phase Overview**

| Phase | Name | Time | Status | Description |
|-------|------|------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Stage Navigation System | 3h | Planning | Stage-based movement & boundaries |
| 2 | Multi-Character Game Loop | 4h | Planning | Team-based game loop & character management |
| 3 | Camera & Boundaries | 3h | Planning | Camera system & stage boundaries |

## 🎯 **Success Criteria**

### **Phase 1: Stage Navigation System**
- ✅ **Stage Movement** - Characters can walk through 2D levels
- ✅ **Stage Boundaries** - Level boundaries and collision detection
- ✅ **Stage Loading** - Various stages can be loaded
- ✅ **Stage Navigation** - Basic movement through levels

### **Phase 2: Multi-Character Game Loop**
- ✅ **Team System** - Support for 1-4 characters per team
- ✅ **Character Management** - Management of multiple characters
- ✅ **Game Loop** - Main game loop for multi-character
- ✅ **State Management** - Game state for teams

### **Phase 3: Camera & Boundaries**
- ✅ **Camera System** - Camera follows the team through the stage
- ✅ **Stage Boundaries** - Level boundaries and collision
- ✅ **Viewport Management** - Display of visible area
- ✅ **Smooth Camera** - Smooth camera movement

## 🔧 **Technical Requirements**

### **Core Systems:**
- **Stage Navigation Engine** - Movement through 2D levels
- **Multi-Character Manager** - Team management
- **Camera Controller** - Camera system for stage following
- **Boundary System** - Level boundaries and collision
- **Game State Manager** - Game state for stage-based gameplay

### **Performance:**
- **60 FPS** - Smooth display
- **Multi-Character Support** - Up to 8 characters simultaneously
- **Stage Loading** - Fast loading of various stages
- **Memory Management** - Efficient resource management
