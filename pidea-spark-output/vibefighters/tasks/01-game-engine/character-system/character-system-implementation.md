- **Logging**: Console logging with different levels for debugging
- **Testing**: Jest framework, 90% coverage requirement
- **Documentation**: JSDoc for all public methods, README updates

## 6. Security Considerations
- [ ] Input validation for character data
- [ ] Sanitize character configuration files
- [ ] Validate character state changes
- [ ] Prevent character manipulation exploits

## 7. Performance Requirements
- **Response Time**: < 16ms (60fps)
- **Memory Usage**: < 50MB for character system
- **Character Limit**: Support up to 8 characters simultaneously
- **Animation Performance**: Smooth 60fps animations
- **Caching Strategy**: Cache character sprites and animations

## 8. Testing Strategy

#### Unit Tests:
- [ ] Test file: `tests/unit/character.test.js`
- [ ] Test cases: Character creation, state changes, movement, team formation
- [ ] Mock requirements: Canvas context, input events

#### Integration Tests:
- [ ] Test file: `tests/integration/character-system.test.js`
- [ ] Test scenarios: Character interaction, team coordination, physics
- [ ] Test data: Character configurations, team setups

#### E2E Tests:
- [ ] Test file: `tests/e2e/character-gameplay.test.js`
- [ ] User flows: Character selection, movement, team play
- [ ] Browser compatibility: Chrome, Firefox, Safari

## 9. Documentation Requirements
- [ ] JSDoc comments for all Character class methods
- [ ] README updates with character system overview
- [ ] Character configuration documentation
- [ ] Movement physics documentation

## 10. Deployment Checklist
- [ ] All tests passing (unit, integration, e2e)
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Character system integrated with game engine
- [ ] Input handling working correctly
- [ ] Team system functional

## 11. Rollback Plan
- [ ] Backup character system files before deployment
- [ ] Revert to previous character implementation if needed
- [ ] Restore character configuration files

## 12. Success Criteria
- [ ] Character class properly implemented with all required properties
- [ ] Movement physics feel natural and responsive
- [ ] Multiple characters supported simultaneously
- [ ] Team system functional with coordination
- [ ] Character states work correctly (idle, walking, jumping, etc.)
- [ ] Collision detection accurate for character interactions
- [ ] Performance optimized for smooth gameplay
- [ ] All tests passing with 90% coverage

## 13. Risk Assessment

#### High Risk:
- [ ] Complex physics implementation - Mitigation: Start with simple physics, iterate
- [ ] Performance with multiple characters - Mitigation: Optimize rendering, use object pooling

#### Medium Risk:
- [ ] Team coordination complexity - Mitigation: Start with basic team formation
- [ ] Character animation system - Mitigation: Use simple sprite-based animations

#### Low Risk:
- [ ] Character configuration - Mitigation: Use JSON configuration files
- [ ] Input handling - Mitigation: Leverage existing input system
