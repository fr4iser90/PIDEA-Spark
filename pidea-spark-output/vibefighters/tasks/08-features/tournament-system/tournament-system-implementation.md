- [ ] `src/game-modes/game-mode-manager.js` - Add tournament mode

#### Files to Create:
- [ ] `src/tournament/tournament-manager.js` - Core tournament system
- [ ] `src/tournament/bracket-system.js` - Tournament bracket management
- [ ] `src/tournament/tournament-ui.js` - Tournament interface
- [ ] `src/tournament/match-scheduler.js` - Match scheduling system
- [ ] `src/tournament/tournament-data.js` - Tournament configurations
- [ ] `src/tournament/prize-system.js` - Prize and reward system

#### Files to Delete:
- [ ] None

## 4. Implementation Phases

#### Phase 1: Tournament Foundation (3 hours)
- [ ] Create tournament manager system
- [ ] Implement tournament data structure
- [ ] Add tournament state management
- [ ] Create tournament UI components
- [ ] Implement tournament persistence

#### Phase 2: Bracket System (3 hours)
- [ ] Implement bracket generation
- [ ] Create match scheduling system
- [ ] Add tournament progression logic
- [ ] Implement winner advancement
- [ ] Create bracket visualization

#### Phase 3: Integration & Polish (2 hours)
- [ ] Integrate with multiplayer system
- [ ] Add spectator mode integration
- [ ] Create tournament statistics
- [ ] Implement prize system
- [ ] Polish tournament interface

## 5. Code Standards & Patterns
- **Coding Style**: ESLint with Airbnb config, Prettier formatting
- **Naming Conventions**: camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for classes
- **Error Handling**: Try-catch with specific error types, proper error logging
- **Logging**: Console logging with different levels for debugging
- **Testing**: Manual testing with browser dev tools
- **Documentation**: JSDoc for all public methods

## 6. Security Considerations
- [ ] Validate tournament data integrity
- [ ] Prevent tournament manipulation
- [ ] Secure tournament progression
- [ ] Protect tournament results

## 7. Performance Requirements
- **Response Time**: <200ms for tournament operations
- **Throughput**: Support 64+ tournament participants
- **Memory Usage**: <20MB for tournament system
- **UI Performance**: Smooth bracket visualization
- **Caching Strategy**: Cache tournament data and brackets

## 8. Testing Strategy

#### Unit Tests:
- [ ] Test file: `tests/unit/TournamentSystem.test.js`
- [ ] Test cases: Tournament management, bracket generation, match scheduling
- [ ] Mock requirements: Multiplayer system, spectator system

#### Integration Tests:
- [ ] Test file: `tests/integration/TournamentSystem.test.js`
- [ ] Test scenarios: End-to-end tournament, multiplayer integration
- [ ] Test data: Mock tournaments, brackets, match results

#### Manual Testing:
- [ ] Tournament management: Smooth tournament operations
- [ ] Bracket system: Accurate bracket generation and progression
- [ ] UI responsiveness: Fast and intuitive interface
- [ ] Integration: Works seamlessly with multiplayer and spectator systems

## 9. Documentation Requirements
- [ ] Tournament system architecture documentation
- [ ] Bracket system design documentation
- [ ] Tournament creation guide
- [ ] Performance optimization guide

## 10. Deployment Checklist
- [ ] Tournament system integration testing
- [ ] Bracket system validation
- [ ] UI/UX testing
- [ ] Performance validation

## 11. Rollback Plan
- [ ] Backup current multiplayer system
- [ ] Maintain tournament-free fallback mode
- [ ] Gradual tournament feature rollout
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting

## 12. Success Criteria
- [ ] Tournament system works smoothly
- [ ] Bracket system generates accurate tournaments
- [ ] UI is intuitive and responsive
- [ ] Integration with other systems is seamless
- [ ] Performance meets requirements

## 13. Risk Assessment
- [ ] **High**: Complex bracket system logic
- [ ] **Medium**: Tournament UI complexity
- [ ] **Low**: Integration with existing systems
