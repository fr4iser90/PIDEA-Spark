# Replay System â€“ Phase 3: Integration & Optimization

## Overview
This phase focuses on integrating the replay system with other game features, optimizing performance, and ensuring the system is production-ready.

## Objectives
- [ ] Integrate with spectator mode
- [ ] Optimize replay file sizes
- [ ] Add replay highlights generation
- [ ] Implement replay cloud storage
- [ ] Final testing and optimization

## Deliverables
- **Spectator**: `src/game/replay/SpectatorIntegration.js` - Spectator mode integration
- **Optimizer**: `src/game/replay/ReplayOptimizer.js` - File size optimization
- **Highlights**: `src/game/replay/HighlightGenerator.js` - Automatic highlight creation
- **Cloud**: `src/game/replay/CloudStorage.js` - Cloud storage integration
- **Compression**: `src/game/replay/ReplayCompression.js` - Data compression
- **Test**: `tests/game/replay-integration.test.js` - Integration tests

## Dependencies
- Requires: Phase 2 completion
- Requires: Task 16 (Spectator Mode) completion
- Blocks: Task completion

## Estimated Time
2 hours (33% of total task time)

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Spectator integration works seamlessly
- [ ] Replay files are optimized for size and performance
- [ ] Highlight generation creates engaging content
- [ ] Cloud storage provides reliable access
- [ ] All integration tests pass
- [ ] System is production-ready
