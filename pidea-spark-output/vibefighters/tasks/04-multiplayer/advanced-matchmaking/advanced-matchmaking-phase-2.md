# Advanced Matchmaking â€“ Phase 2: Advanced Algorithms & Optimization

## Overview
This phase implements advanced matchmaking algorithms, including region-based matching, connection quality optimization, and sophisticated skill balancing.

## Objectives
- [ ] Implement region-based matchmaking
- [ ] Add connection quality assessment
- [ ] Develop advanced skill balancing algorithms
- [ ] Create match quality scoring system
- [ ] Optimize queue performance

## Deliverables
- **Region**: `src/game/multiplayer/matchmaking/RegionMatcher.js` - Geographic matching
- **Connection**: `src/game/multiplayer/matchmaking/ConnectionQuality.js` - Network assessment
