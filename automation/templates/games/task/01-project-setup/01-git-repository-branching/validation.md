# Git Repository & Branching Strategy - Validation

## Success Criteria

### 1. Repository Setup ✅
- [ ] Git repository initialized in project root
- [ ] Remote repository URL configured
- [ ] Initial commit created successfully
- [ ] Repository accessible via HTTPS/SSH

### 2. Branching Strategy ✅
- [ ] `main` branch exists and is default
- [ ] `develop` branch created from main
- [ ] Both branches pushed to remote
- [ ] Branch protection rules configured

### 3. Configuration Files ✅
- [ ] `.gitignore` file created and comprehensive
- [ ] `CONTRIBUTING.md` contains branching guidelines
- [ ] `README.md` updated with setup instructions
- [ ] All configuration files committed

### 4. Team Access ✅
- [ ] All team members can clone repository
- [ ] Team members can create feature branches
- [ ] Push/pull operations work correctly
- [ ] Branch protection prevents direct pushes to main

## Validation Tests

### Test 1: Repository Access
```bash
# Test repository cloning
git clone <repository-url> test-clone
cd test-clone
git status
# Should show clean working directory
```

### Test 2: Branching Workflow
```bash
# Test feature branch creation
git checkout -b feature/test-branch
git push -u origin feature/test-branch
# Should create and push feature branch
```

### Test 3: .gitignore Functionality
```bash
# Test .gitignore
echo "test-file.txt" > test-file.txt
git status
# Should not show test-file.txt as untracked
```

### Test 4: Branch Protection
```bash
# Try to push directly to main (should fail)
git checkout main
echo "test" > test.txt
git add test.txt
git commit -m "test"
git push origin main
# Should be blocked by branch protection
```
