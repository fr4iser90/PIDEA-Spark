# Replay System â€“ Phase 1: Basic Recording & Playback Foundation

## Overview
This phase establishes the foundation for the replay system, implementing basic match recording and playback functionality.

## Objectives
- [ ] Design replay system architecture
- [ ] Implement basic match recording
- [ ] Create replay playback system
- [ ] Add replay file management
- [ ] Design replay UI components

## Deliverables
- **Architecture**: `src/game/replay/ReplayArchitecture.js` - Replay system foundation
- **Recording**: `src/game/replay/MatchRecorder.js` - Match recording functionality
- **Playback**: `src/game/replay/ReplayPlayer.js` - Replay playback system
- **Storage**: `src/game/replay/ReplayStorage.js` - Replay file management
- **UI**: `src/game/ui/replay/ReplayUI.js` - Replay interface
- **Format**: `src/game/replay/ReplayFormat.js` - Replay file format
- **Test**: `tests/game/replay.test.js` - Replay system tests

## Dependencies
- Requires: Task 3 (Combat System & Collision) completion
- Requires: Task 13 (Statistics & Leaderboards) completion
- Blocks: Phase 2 start

## Estimated Time
2 hours (33% of total task time)

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Replay architecture is efficient and scalable
- [ ] Match recording captures all essential data
- [ ] Replay playback is smooth and accurate
- [ ] Replay files are properly managed
- [ ] Replay UI is intuitive and functional
- [ ] All replay tests pass
