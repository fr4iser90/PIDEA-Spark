# Statistics & Leaderboards â€“ Phase 3: Integration & Performance Optimization

## Overview
This phase focuses on integrating the statistics system with other game features, optimizing performance for large datasets, and ensuring the system is production-ready.

## Objectives
- [ ] Integrate with replay system
- [ ] Optimize database performance
- [ ] Add real-time statistics updates
- [ ] Implement statistics export features
- [ ] Final testing and optimization

## Deliverables
- **Replay**: `src/game/statistics/ReplayIntegration.js` - Replay system integration
- **Optimizer**: `src/game/statistics/PerformanceOptimizer.js` - Database and query optimization
- **Real-time**: `src/game/statistics/RealTimeStats.js` - Live statistics updates
- **Export**: `src/game/statistics/StatisticsExport.js` - Data export functionality
- **Cache**: `src/game/statistics/StatisticsCache.js` - Caching system
- **Test**: `tests/game/statistics-integration.test.js` - Integration tests

## Dependencies
- Requires: Phase 2 completion
- Requires: Task 15 (Replay System) completion
- Blocks: Task completion

## Estimated Time
2 hours (33% of total task time)
