# Assets & Sprites System â€“ Phase 1: Character Sprites

## Overview
Create comprehensive character sprite system with sprite sheets, animation system, state-based sprite switching, and optimized rendering for all character types in the game.

## Objectives
- [ ] Create character sprite sheets for all character types (Fighter, Mage, Archer, Tank)
- [ ] Implement sprite animation system with frame-based animation
- [ ] Add character state-based sprite switching (idle, walk, attack, hurt, death)
- [ ] Create sprite rendering optimization for performance
- [ ] Add sprite collision detection support for accurate hitboxes
- [ ] Implement sprite scaling and rotation for dynamic effects
- [ ] Create sprite caching system for efficient memory usage

## Deliverables
- File: `assets/sprites/characters/` - Character sprite sheets
- File: `utils/sprite-manager.js` - Sprite rendering and animation system
- File: `utils/asset-loader.js` - Asset loading and management
- File: `config/assets-config.js` - Asset configuration
- Integration: Sprite system integrated with character system
- Test: Sprite rendering and animation tests

## Dependencies
- Requires: Character System & Movement
- Blocks: Background Assets (Phase 2)

## Estimated Time
4 hours
