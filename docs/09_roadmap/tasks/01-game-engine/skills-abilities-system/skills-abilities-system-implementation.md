- **Backend Changes**: None (client-side only)

## 3. File Impact Analysis
#### Files to Modify:
- [ ] `src/game/characters.js` - Add skill system integration
- [ ] `src/game/combat.js` - Integrate abilities with combat
- [ ] `src/game/engine.js` - Add skill management to game loop

#### Files to Create:
- [ ] `src/game/skills/skill-manager.js` - Core skill management system
- [ ] `src/game/skills/ability-system.js` - Ability execution and effects
- [ ] `src/game/skills/skill-data.js` - Skill definitions and configurations
- [ ] `src/game/skills/skill-ui.js` - Skill UI and controls
- [ ] `src/game/skills/cooldown-system.js` - Cooldown management
- [ ] `src/game/skills/effect-system.js` - Visual and gameplay effects

#### Files to Delete:
- [ ] None

## 4. Implementation Phases

#### Phase 1: Skill Foundation (3 hours)
- [ ] Create skill manager system
- [ ] Implement skill data structure
- [ ] Set up skill registration system
- [ ] Add basic skill execution framework
- [ ] Create skill configuration system

#### Phase 2: Ability System (4 hours)
- [ ] Implement ability execution engine
- [ ] Create effect system for abilities
- [ ] Add cooldown management
- [ ] Implement skill targeting system
- [ ] Add ability animations and effects

#### Phase 3: Integration & UI (3 hours)
- [ ] Integrate with character system
- [ ] Create skill UI components
- [ ] Add skill controls and input
- [ ] Implement skill progression system
- [ ] Add visual feedback and effects

## 5. Code Standards & Patterns
- **Coding Style**: ESLint with Airbnb config, Prettier formatting
- **Naming Conventions**: camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for classes
- **Error Handling**: Try-catch with specific error types, proper error logging
- **Logging**: Console logging with different levels for debugging
- **Testing**: Manual testing with browser dev tools
- **Documentation**: JSDoc for all public methods

## 6. Security Considerations
- [ ] Input validation for skill activation
- [ ] Prevent skill exploitation through timing
- [ ] Validate skill data integrity
- [ ] Secure skill progression system

## 7. Performance Requirements
- **Response Time**: <16ms for skill activation
- **Throughput**: Support multiple simultaneous abilities
- **Memory Usage**: <10MB for skill system
- **Animation Performance**: Smooth skill effects
- **Caching Strategy**: Cache skill data and effects

## 8. Testing Strategy

#### Unit Tests:
- [ ] Test file: `tests/unit/SkillSystem.test.js`
- [ ] Test cases: Skill activation, cooldowns, effects
- [ ] Mock requirements: Character system, combat system

#### Integration Tests:
- [ ] Test file: `tests/integration/SkillSystem.test.js`
- [ ] Test scenarios: Skill integration, UI interaction
- [ ] Test data: Mock skill configurations, character states

#### Manual Testing:
- [ ] Skill activation: Proper execution and effects
- [ ] Cooldown system: Accurate timing and UI updates
- [ ] Skill UI: Responsive and intuitive controls
- [ ] Performance: Smooth execution on target devices

## 9. Documentation Requirements
- [ ] Skill system architecture documentation
- [ ] API documentation for skill creation
- [ ] User guide for skill usage
- [ ] Performance optimization guide

## 10. Deployment Checklist
- [ ] Skill system integration testing
- [ ] Performance validation
- [ ] UI/UX testing
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility

## 11. Rollback Plan
- [ ] Backup current character system
- [ ] Maintain skill-free fallback mode
- [ ] Gradual feature rollout
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting

## 12. Success Criteria
- [ ] Skills can be activated and executed properly
- [ ] Cooldown system works accurately
- [ ] Skill UI is responsive and intuitive
- [ ] Integration with combat system is seamless
- [ ] Performance meets 60fps target

## 13. Risk Assessment
- [ ] **High**: Complex skill interactions may cause performance issues
- [ ] **Medium**: UI complexity may impact user experience
- [ ] **Low**: Integration with existing systems
