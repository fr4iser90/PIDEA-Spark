- **Error Handling**: Try-catch with specific error types, proper error logging
- **Logging**: Console logging with different levels for debugging
- **Testing**: Jest framework, 90% coverage requirement
- **Documentation**: JSDoc for all public methods, README updates

## 6. Security Considerations
- [ ] Validate attack data and damage calculations
- [ ] Prevent combat system exploits
- [ ] Sanitize combat configuration files
- [ ] Validate combat state transitions

## 7. Performance Requirements
- **Response Time**: < 16ms (60fps)
- **Memory Usage**: < 30MB for combat system
- **Hit Detection**: Accurate and fast collision detection
- **Combat Effects**: Smooth visual feedback
- **Caching Strategy**: Cache attack animations and effects

## 8. Testing Strategy

#### Unit Tests:
- [ ] Test file: `tests/unit/combat.test.js`
- [ ] Test cases: Attack mechanics, damage calculation, hit detection, health system
- [ ] Mock requirements: Character instances, collision detection

#### Integration Tests:
- [ ] Test file: `tests/integration/combat-system.test.js`
- [ ] Test scenarios: Combat between characters, team battles, victory conditions
- [ ] Test data: Combat configurations, character setups

#### E2E Tests:
- [ ] Test file: `tests/e2e/combat-gameplay.test.js`
- [ ] User flows: Combat initiation, attack execution, victory/defeat
- [ ] Browser compatibility: Chrome, Firefox, Safari

## 9. Documentation Requirements
- [ ] JSDoc comments for all Combat class methods
- [ ] README updates with combat system overview
- [ ] Combat configuration documentation
- [ ] Attack mechanics documentation

## 10. Deployment Checklist
- [ ] All tests passing (unit, integration, e2e)
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Combat system integrated with game engine
- [ ] Hit detection working correctly
- [ ] Victory conditions functional

## 11. Rollback Plan
- [ ] Backup combat system files before deployment
- [ ] Revert to previous combat implementation if needed
- [ ] Restore combat configuration files

## 12. Success Criteria
- [ ] Combat system properly implemented with attack mechanics
- [ ] Hit detection accurate and responsive
- [ ] Health and damage system functional
- [ ] Victory conditions work correctly
- [ ] Combat feels responsive and fair
- [ ] Balance system implemented
- [ ] Performance maintained at 60fps
- [ ] All tests passing with 90% coverage

## 13. Risk Assessment

#### High Risk:
- [ ] Complex hit detection - Mitigation: Start with simple detection, iterate
- [ ] Combat balance - Mitigation: Extensive testing, data-driven balance

#### Medium Risk:
- [ ] Performance with multiple combatants - Mitigation: Optimize early, monitor performance
- [ ] Combat state management - Mitigation: Clear state machine, thorough testing

#### Low Risk:
- [ ] Basic attack mechanics - Mitigation: Simple implementation, gradual complexity
- [ ] Health system - Mitigation: Standard health mechanics, clear documentation
