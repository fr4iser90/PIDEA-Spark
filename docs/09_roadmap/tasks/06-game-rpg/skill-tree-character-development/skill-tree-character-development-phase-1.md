# Skill Tree & Character Development â€“ Phase 1: Basic Skill Tree Foundation

## Overview
This phase establishes the foundation for the skill tree and character development system, implementing basic skill trees and character progression mechanics.

## Objectives
- [ ] Design skill tree architecture
- [ ] Implement basic skill tree system
- [ ] Create character development paths
- [ ] Add skill point allocation
- [ ] Design skill tree UI

## Deliverables
- **Architecture**: `src/game/skilltree/SkillTreeArchitecture.js` - Skill tree system foundation
- **Trees**: `src/game/skilltree/SkillTrees.js` - Basic skill tree implementation
- **Development**: `src/game/skilltree/CharacterDevelopment.js` - Character progression paths
- **Points**: `src/game/skilltree/SkillPoints.js` - Skill point allocation system
- **UI**: `src/game/ui/skilltree/SkillTreeUI.js` - Skill tree interface
- **Validation**: `src/game/skilltree/SkillValidation.js` - Skill validation logic
- **Test**: `tests/game/skilltree.test.js` - Skill tree system tests

## Dependencies
- Requires: Task 25 (Experience & Leveling System) completion
- Requires: Task 8 (Skills & Abilities System) completion
- Blocks: Phase 2 start

## Estimated Time
2.5 hours (31.25% of total task time)

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Skill tree architecture supports complex trees
- [ ] Basic skill tree system works correctly
- [ ] Character development paths are meaningful
- [ ] Skill point allocation is balanced
- [ ] Skill tree UI is intuitive and functional
- [ ] All skill tree tests pass
