# Skill Tree & Character Development â€“ Phase 3: Integration & Optimization

## Overview
This phase focuses on integrating the skill tree system with other game features, optimizing performance, and ensuring the system is production-ready.

## Objectives
- [ ] Integrate with equipment and stats system
- [ ] Connect with combat system
- [ ] Optimize skill tree performance
- [ ] Add skill tree analytics
- [ ] Final testing and polish

## Deliverables
- **Equipment**: `src/game/skilltree/EquipmentIntegration.js` - Equipment system integration
- **Combat**: `src/game/skilltree/CombatIntegration.js` - Combat system connection
- **Optimizer**: `src/game/skilltree/SkillTreeOptimizer.js` - Performance optimization
- **Analytics**: `src/game/skilltree/SkillTreeAnalytics.js` - Skill tree usage analytics
- **Sync**: `src/game/skilltree/SkillTreeSync.js` - Cross-system synchronization
- **Test**: `tests/game/skilltree-integration.test.js` - Integration tests

## Dependencies
- Requires: Phase 2 completion
- Requires: Task 27 (Equipment & Stats System) completion
