# Skill Tree & Character Development â€“ Phase 2: Advanced Features & Character Specialization

## Overview
This phase implements advanced skill tree features including character specialization, advanced skill mechanics, and sophisticated development paths.

## Objectives
- [ ] Implement character specialization
- [ ] Add advanced skill mechanics
- [ ] Create skill synergies
- [ ] Develop respec system
- [ ] Add skill tree presets

## Deliverables
- **Specialization**: `src/game/skilltree/CharacterSpecialization.js` - Character specialization system
- **Mechanics**: `src/game/skilltree/AdvancedMechanics.js` - Advanced skill mechanics
- **Synergies**: `src/game/skilltree/SkillSynergies.js` - Skill combination effects
- **Respec**: `src/game/skilltree/RespecSystem.js` - Skill point respecification
- **Presets**: `src/game/skilltree/SkillPresets.js` - Pre-built skill configurations
- **Builds**: `src/game/skilltree/BuildSystem.js` - Character build management
- **Test**: `tests/game/advanced-skilltree.test.js` - Advanced skill tree tests

## Dependencies
- Requires: Phase 1 completion
- Blocks: Phase 3 start

## Estimated Time
3 hours (37.5% of total task time)

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Character specialization creates unique builds
- [ ] Advanced mechanics add depth to gameplay
- [ ] Skill synergies encourage strategic thinking
- [ ] Respec system allows experimentation
- [ ] Skill presets help new players
- [ ] All advanced skill tree tests pass
