#### Files to Delete:
- [ ] None

## 4. Implementation Phases

#### Phase 1: Equipment Stats & Bonuses (2 hours)
- [ ] Create EquipmentSystem class with stat management
- [ ] Implement equipment stat calculations
- [ ] Add equipment bonuses to character stats
- [ ] Create equipment comparison system

#### Phase 2: Character Attribute System (2 hours)
- [ ] Define character attributes (Strength, Agility, Intelligence, etc.)
- [ ] Implement attribute point allocation
- [ ] Add attribute-based stat calculations
- [ ] Create character sheet interface

#### Phase 3: Equipment Progression (2 hours)
- [ ] Implement equipment upgrade system
- [ ] Add equipment rarity and quality
- [ ] Create equipment crafting/enhancement
- [ ] Add equipment progression tracking

## 5. Code Standards & Patterns
- **Coding Style**: ESLint with existing project rules, Prettier formatting
- **Naming Conventions**: camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for classes
- **Error Handling**: Try-catch with specific error types, proper error logging
- **Logging**: Console logging for debugging, structured equipment events
- **Testing**: Jest framework, 90% coverage requirement
- **Documentation**: JSDoc for all public methods, README updates

## 6. Security Considerations
- [ ] Validate equipment stats to prevent cheating
- [ ] Sanitize equipment data in Local Storage
- [ ] Implement integrity checks for equipment state
- [ ] Add validation for equipment requirements

## 7. Performance Requirements
- **Response Time**: < 16ms for equipment changes
- **Memory Usage**: < 10MB for equipment data
- **Stat Calculations**: Efficient real-time stat updates
- **UI Updates**: Smooth equipment interface

## 8. Testing Strategy

#### Unit Tests:
- [ ] Test file: `tests/unit/EquipmentSystem.test.js`
- [ ] Test cases: Equipment stats, bonuses, requirements
- [ ] Mock requirements: Character system, Local Storage

#### Integration Tests:
- [ ] Test file: `tests/integration/CharacterStats.test.js`
- [ ] Test scenarios: Full equipment and stats integration
- [ ] Test data: Mock equipment, character attributes

## 9. Documentation Requirements
- [ ] JSDoc comments for all equipment classes
- [ ] README updates with equipment system
- [ ] User guide for equipment and stats
- [ ] Equipment stat formulas documentation

## 10. Deployment Checklist
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Equipment UI integrated
- [ ] Stats system working
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met

## 11. Rollback Plan
- [ ] Local Storage backup before changes
- [ ] Equipment data rollback procedure
- [ ] Stats system rollback

## 12. Success Criteria
- [ ] Equipment system provides stat bonuses
- [ ] Character attributes affect combat performance
- [ ] Equipment progression system works
- [ ] Stats are calculated correctly
- [ ] Equipment UI is intuitive
- [ ] Character sheet displays all stats

## 13. Risk Assessment

#### High Risk:
- [ ] Complex stat calculation performance - Mitigation: Optimized calculations
- [ ] Equipment balance issues - Mitigation: Extensive testing and iteration

#### Medium Risk:
- [ ] UI complexity for equipment - Mitigation: Intuitive design
- [ ] Stat calculation bugs - Mitigation: Comprehensive testing

#### Low Risk:
- [ ] Minor UI glitches - Mitigation: Thorough testing
