# Game Modes & Progression â€“ Phase 1: Basic Modes & Progression Foundation

## Overview
This phase establishes the foundation for game modes and progression systems, implementing basic modes and the core progression mechanics.

## Objectives
- [ ] Design game mode architecture
- [ ] Implement basic game modes (Arcade, Versus, Training)
- [ ] Create progression system foundation
- [ ] Add basic scoring and ranking
- [ ] Design mode selection UI

## Deliverables
- **Architecture**: `src/game/modes/GameModeArchitecture.js` - Mode system foundation
- **Modes**: `src/game/modes/BasicModes.js` - Arcade, Versus, Training modes
- **Progression**: `src/game/progression/ProgressionSystem.js` - Core progression mechanics
- **Scoring**: `src/game/progression/ScoringSystem.js` - Score calculation and ranking
