# Level Design & Stages â€“ Phase 1: Stage Foundation & Basic Design

## Overview
This phase establishes the foundation for level design and stage creation, implementing basic stage systems and creating the first set of playable stages.

## Objectives
- [ ] Design stage architecture and structure
- [ ] Create basic stage templates
- [ ] Implement stage loading system
- [ ] Design first 3 basic stages
- [ ] Add stage boundaries and collision

## Deliverables
- **Architecture**: `src/game/stages/StageArchitecture.js` - Stage system foundation
- **Templates**: `src/game/stages/StageTemplates.js` - Reusable stage templates
- **Loader**: `src/game/stages/StageLoader.js` - Stage loading and management
- **Stages**: `src/game/stages/BasicStages.js` - First 3 basic stages
- **Collision**: `src/game/stages/StageCollision.js` - Stage boundary system
- **Assets**: `src/assets/stages/` - Stage background assets
- **Test**: `tests/game/stages.test.js` - Stage system tests

## Dependencies
- Requires: Task 6 (Assets & Sprites System) completion
- Blocks: Phase 2 start

## Estimated Time
3 hours (30% of total task time)

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Stage architecture is flexible and extensible
- [ ] Basic stage templates work correctly
- [ ] Stage loading system is efficient
- [ ] First 3 stages are playable and balanced
- [ ] Stage boundaries prevent out-of-bounds movement
- [ ] All stage tests pass
