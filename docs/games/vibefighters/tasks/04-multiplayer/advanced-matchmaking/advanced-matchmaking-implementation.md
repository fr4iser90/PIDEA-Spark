## 4. Implementation Phases

#### Phase 1: Skill Rating System (2 hours)
- [ ] Implement skill rating calculation
- [ ] Create player skill database
- [ ] Add rating adjustment algorithms
- [ ] Implement skill-based matchmaking
- [ ] Add rating confidence system

#### Phase 2: Queue Management (2 hours)
- [ ] Create matchmaking queue system
- [ ] Implement queue prioritization
- [ ] Add queue time estimation
- [ ] Create queue status indicators
- [ ] Implement queue cancellation

#### Phase 3: Advanced Features (2 hours)
- [ ] Add matchmaking preferences
- [ ] Implement region-based matching
- [ ] Create skill range controls
- [ ] Add matchmaking statistics
- [ ] Implement match quality indicators

## 5. Code Standards & Patterns
- **Coding Style**: ESLint with Airbnb config, Prettier formatting
- **Naming Conventions**: camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for classes
- **Error Handling**: Try-catch with specific error types, proper error logging
- **Logging**: Console logging with different levels for debugging
- **Testing**: Manual testing with browser dev tools
- **Documentation**: JSDoc for all public methods

## 6. Security Considerations
- [ ] Prevent matchmaking manipulation
- [ ] Secure skill rating calculations
- [ ] Validate matchmaking preferences
- [ ] Protect against queue abuse

## 7. Performance Requirements
- **Response Time**: <500ms for matchmaking decisions
- **Throughput**: Support 100+ concurrent players
- **Memory Usage**: <10MB for matchmaking system
- **Queue Time**: <30 seconds average wait time
- **Caching Strategy**: Cache player ratings and preferences

## 8. Testing Strategy

#### Unit Tests:
- [ ] Test file: `tests/unit/MatchmakingSystem.test.js`
- [ ] Test cases: Skill rating, queue management, matching algorithm
- [ ] Mock requirements: Player data, statistics system

#### Integration Tests:
- [ ] Test file: `tests/integration/MatchmakingSystem.test.js`
- [ ] Test scenarios: End-to-end matchmaking, multiplayer integration
- [ ] Test data: Mock player pools, skill distributions

#### Manual Testing:
- [ ] Matchmaking accuracy: Proper skill-based matching
- [ ] Queue performance: Fast and fair queue times
- [ ] Matchmaking UI: Responsive and informative interface
- [ ] Integration: Works seamlessly with multiplayer system

## 9. Documentation Requirements
- [ ] Matchmaking system architecture documentation
- [ ] Skill rating algorithm documentation
- [ ] User guide for matchmaking preferences
- [ ] Performance optimization guide

## 10. Deployment Checklist
- [ ] Matchmaking system integration testing
- [ ] Performance validation with multiple players
- [ ] Queue time optimization
- [ ] UI/UX validation

## 11. Rollback Plan
- [ ] Backup current multiplayer system
- [ ] Maintain basic matchmaking fallback
- [ ] Gradual advanced feature rollout
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting

## 12. Success Criteria
- [ ] Skill-based matching works accurately
- [ ] Queue times are reasonable (<30 seconds)
- [ ] Matchmaking UI is user-friendly
- [ ] Integration with multiplayer system is seamless
- [ ] Performance meets requirements under load

## 13. Risk Assessment
- [ ] **High**: Complex skill rating algorithms
- [ ] **Medium**: Queue performance under load
- [ ] **Low**: Integration with existing systems
