- [ ] Create lobby manager for room listing
- [ ] Implement room creation and joining
- [ ] Add basic player connection handling
- [ ] Create lobby UI with room browser
- [ ] Implement room status and player count

#### Phase 2: Room Management (4 hours)
- [ ] Implement room settings and configuration
- [ ] Add player team assignment system
- [ ] Create room chat functionality
- [ ] Implement room state management
- [ ] Add room moderation features

#### Phase 3: Player Profiles (4 hours)
- [ ] Create player profile system
- [ ] Implement player statistics tracking
- [ ] Add friend system and player search
- [ ] Create player customization options
- [ ] Implement player reputation system

## 5. Code Standards & Patterns
- **Coding Style**: ES6+ with async/await patterns
- **Naming Conventions**: camelCase for variables, PascalCase for classes
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive connection error handling
- **Logging**: Multiplayer event logging
- **Testing**: Multiplayer functionality testing
- **Documentation**: Multiplayer system documentation

## 6. Security Considerations
- [ ] Player input validation and sanitization
- [ ] Room access control and permissions
- [ ] Chat moderation and filtering
- [ ] Player data protection

## 7. Performance Requirements
- **Response Time**: < 100ms for lobby interactions
- **Throughput**: Support 50+ concurrent rooms
- **Memory Usage**: < 100MB for multiplayer system
- **Connection**: Stable peer-to-peer connections
- **Caching Strategy**: Room and player data caching

## 8. Testing Strategy
#### Unit Tests:
- [ ] Lobby management tests
- [ ] Room creation and joining tests
- [ ] Player profile tests

#### Integration Tests:
- [ ] Multiplayer game session tests
- [ ] Chat system integration tests
- [ ] Player matching tests

#### E2E Tests:
- [ ] Complete multiplayer experience
- [ ] Room management workflows
- [ ] Player interaction scenarios

## 9. Documentation Requirements
- [ ] Multiplayer system architecture
- [ ] Room management guide
- [ ] Player profile documentation
- [ ] Chat system guidelines

## 10. Deployment Checklist
- [ ] Multiplayer system tested
- [ ] Room management functional
- [ ] Player profiles working
- [ ] Chat system operational

## 11. Rollback Plan
- [ ] Keep single-player mode as fallback
- [ ] Maintain local multiplayer option
- [ ] Document multiplayer rollback procedures

## 12. Success Criteria
- [ ] Players can create and join rooms easily
- [ ] Room management is intuitive and functional
- [ ] Player profiles enhance social experience
- [ ] Chat system facilitates communication
- [ ] Multiplayer sessions are stable and responsive
- [ ] System supports multiple concurrent games

## 13. Risk Assessment
