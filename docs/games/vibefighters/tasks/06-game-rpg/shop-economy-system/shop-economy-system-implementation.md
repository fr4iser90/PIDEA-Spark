- [ ] Implement currency system
- [ ] Add player wallet management
- [ ] Create economy persistence
- [ ] Implement currency display

#### Phase 2: Shop System (1.5 hours)
- [ ] Implement shop management
- [ ] Create item catalog system
- [ ] Add transaction processing
- [ ] Implement shop UI
- [ ] Create shopkeeper interactions

#### Phase 3: Integration & Polish (1 hour)

## 5. Code Standards & Patterns
- **Coding Style**: ESLint with Airbnb config, Prettier formatting
- **Naming Conventions**: camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for classes
- **Error Handling**: Try-catch with specific error types, proper error logging
- **Logging**: Console logging with different levels for debugging
- **Testing**: Manual testing with browser dev tools
- **Documentation**: JSDoc for all public methods

## 6. Security Considerations
- [ ] Validate transaction data integrity
- [ ] Prevent currency manipulation
- [ ] Secure shop transactions
- [ ] Protect economy data storage

## 7. Performance Requirements
- **Response Time**: <100ms for shop operations
- **Throughput**: Support 100+ shop items
- **Memory Usage**: <10MB for shop system
- **UI Performance**: Smooth shop interface
- **Caching Strategy**: Cache shop data and prices

## 8. Testing Strategy

#### Unit Tests:
- [ ] Test file: `tests/unit/ShopSystem.test.js`
- [ ] Test cases: Shop operations, transactions, economy
- [ ] Mock requirements: Inventory system, NPC system

#### Integration Tests:
- [ ] Test file: `tests/integration/ShopSystem.test.js`
- [ ] Test scenarios: End-to-end shopping, economy integration
- [ ] Test data: Mock items, prices, transactions

#### Manual Testing:
- [ ] Shop operations: Smooth buying and selling
- [ ] Economy system: Accurate currency management
- [ ] UI responsiveness: Fast and intuitive interface
- [ ] Integration: Works seamlessly with inventory and NPC systems

## 9. Documentation Requirements
- [ ] Shop system architecture documentation
- [ ] Economy system design documentation
- [ ] Shop creation guide
- [ ] Performance optimization guide

## 10. Deployment Checklist
- [ ] Shop system integration testing
- [ ] Economy validation
- [ ] UI/UX testing
- [ ] Performance validation

## 11. Rollback Plan
- [ ] Backup current game systems
- [ ] Maintain shop-free fallback mode
- [ ] Gradual shop feature rollout
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting

## 12. Success Criteria
- [ ] Shop system works smoothly
- [ ] Economy system is balanced
- [ ] UI is intuitive and responsive
- [ ] Integration with other systems is seamless
- [ ] Performance meets requirements

## 13. Risk Assessment
- [ ] **High**: Economy balance and inflation
- [ ] **Medium**: Shop UI complexity
- [ ] **Low**: Integration with existing systems
