# Experience & Leveling System â€“ Phase 2: Advanced Leveling & Progression Paths

## Overview
This phase implements advanced leveling features including multiple progression paths, prestige systems, and sophisticated experience mechanics.

## Objectives
- [ ] Implement multiple progression paths
- [ ] Add prestige and rebirth systems
- [ ] Create advanced experience mechanics
- [ ] Develop level cap systems
- [ ] Add experience multipliers

## Deliverables
- **Paths**: `src/game/experience/ProgressionPaths.js` - Multiple progression routes
- **Prestige**: `src/game/experience/PrestigeSystem.js` - Prestige and rebirth mechanics
- **Mechanics**: `src/game/experience/AdvancedMechanics.js` - Sophisticated experience systems
- **Caps**: `src/game/experience/LevelCaps.js` - Level cap management
- **Multipliers**: `src/game/experience/ExperienceMultipliers.js` - Experience boost system
- **Specialization**: `src/game/experience/SpecializationSystem.js` - Character specialization
- **Test**: `tests/game/advanced-experience.test.js` - Advanced experience tests

## Dependencies
- Requires: Phase 1 completion
